<div class="main">
	Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion.
	<br>If we want to accelerate an object, then we must apply a force.
	<br>Applying a force requires us to do work.
	<br>After work has been done, energy has been transferred to the object, and the object will be moving with a new constant speed.
	<br>The energy transferred is known as kinetic energy, and it depends on the mass and speed achieved.
	<br>Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.
	<br>For example, a toy car hits a toy ball.
	<br>Following the collision, some of the initial kinetic energy of the toy car might have been transferred into the ball or transformed to some other form of energy.
